# Forgiac
 A reflection based forge wrapper. 

# WIP: Planned features

## Short term 
1) Command line support. 
> Mostly the ability to specify a .minecraft folder and the location of a forge installer jar
2) A swing installer GUI 
> Just something simple to show how far the installation has progressed. 
3) manifest.json and version.json generator
> Mostly there to make it easier to redistribute it with a launcher. 

## Compatibility: 
1.12+ (Tested so far)
