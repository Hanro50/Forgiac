# Forgiac
 A reflection based forge wrapper. 

# WIP: Planned features

## Short term 
1) Command line support. 
> Mostly the ability to specify a .minecraft folder and the location of a forge installer jar
2) A ~~swing~~ javaFX based installer GUI 
> Just something simple to show how far the installation has progressed. Swing got axed due to me being to lazy to install eclipse to edit Guis
3) manifest.json and version.json generator
> Mostly there to make it easier to redistribute this library with a custom launcher that can decode version.jsons and version manifest files. 

## Compatibility: 
1.12+ (Tested so far)
